xpathr - Collaborative XSLT Development


## ui3

The `ui3` branch of the xpathr repository is an experimental branch for the development of a
user interface for xpathr. The intention is to adapt the interface of [JS Bin](http://jsbin.com/) for an updated version
of an application for collaborative XSLT development created with [Symphony CMS](http://getsymphony.com/).


### User Interface

The roadmap for the user interface intends to add the ability to integrate XML, XSLT, CSS and JavaScript
to create output which includes rendered HTML, but can also be used for many other text-based output formats.

While an attempt has already been made to adapt JS Bin with the `ui2` branch, the code has not kept pace
with the current development of JS Bin. So, in an effort to get back up to speed and integrate improvements
from the latest development, I am starting over.


## About xpathr

xpathr is an open source collaborative XSLT debugging tool developed with [Symphony CMS](http://getsymphony.com/) and the [GitHub API](http://developer.github.com/v3/gists/) for sharing code snippets as gists.

If you want to get involved to help make xpathr better (or perhaps fix a bug you've found), please fork [xpathr on GitHub](http://github.com/alpacaaa/xpathr) and send a pull request.
