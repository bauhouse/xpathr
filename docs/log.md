## Development Log

As a reminder of what I've done so far, I am keeping a log of the work completed to date.

 - 28 Aug 2014
 	 - Begin working on the xpathr UI by creating the [`ui3`](https://github.com/bauhouse/xpathr/tree/ui3) branch of the GitHub xpathr repository
 	 - Copy [CSS](https://github.com/jsbin/jsbin/tree/master/public/css) and [JS](https://github.com/jsbin/jsbin/tree/master/public/js) files from the JS Bin project
 	 - Create [README](https://github.com/bauhouse/xpathr/tree/ui3/README.md) file
 	 - Begin documenting the development by creating a [Development Log](https://github.com/bauhouse/xpathr/tree/ui3/docs/log.md) file
 	 - Create `index.html` as a static HTML file and fix links to local resources
